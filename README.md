# Pothole-Detection-Using-OpenCV
## Problem Statement: 
The goal of our project is to design a Pothole detection System. which assists the driver in avoiding potholes on the roads, by giving the driver prior warnings.
## Algorithm Used:
Applied Contour detection and Canny edge filter algorithms in Open CV to alert the vehicle driver in the presence of potholes.
## Libraries Used: 
OpenCv, Matplotlib, Pygame
